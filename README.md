# Learning and practicing creative coding with py5

This repo contains sketches I'm creating while learning the py5 framework for Python.

## What is creative coding?

Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional.

## What is py5?

Py5 is a creative coding framework for Python 3.8+. The goal of py5 is to create a version of Processing that is integrated into the Python ecosystem. Internally py5 uses Processing's core libraries, which are written in Java, while providing the end user with a (mostly) seamless Python programming experience.

## Why am I learning py5 and why should you as a data scientist?

I just love art! And math! And data! Why not merging them all into something beautiful and challenging? Do creative coding is fun, but there are lots of other reasons for data people to learn py5, such as improving data visualizations and presentations, get better at design, develop creativity and so much more. There is a great article all about it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/creative-coding-data-people-barton-poulson-phd-18gvc/).

Try it as hobby, you may like it :)
